# Medicare-Provider-Fraud-Detection
## Introduction
The US spends over $4 trillion per year on healthcare, which is largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. Overbilling, waste, and fraud by providers to receive higher payments is a major concern in healthcare system. In this work, I use large-scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for elderly adults and the disabled, to perform an exploratory data analysis. The goal is to identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling and understand characteristics associated with high suspiciousness of fraud. My proposed approach for fraud detection is supervised relying on labeled training data.  I develop a broad range of cclassifiers to help identify if potential providers will overbill insurer. By indentify the important features that affect models,  provide reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of flagged providers. Additionally, I apply SMOTE techniques to handle imbalanced data and improve 1-fold lift recall for the minority/fraud class. All results can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious providers for both public and private health insurance systems.
