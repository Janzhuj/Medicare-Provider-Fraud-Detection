# Medicare-Provider-Fraud-Detection
The US spends over $4 trillion per year on healthcare, which is largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. Overbilling, waste, and fraud are major concerns in the healthcare system and are estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to account for 3% to 10% of overall spending. Provider fraud occurs when healthcare providers misreport their claims to receive higher payments. In this work, I use large-scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for elderly adults and the disabled, to perform an exploratory data analysis. My goal is to identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling and understand characteristics associated with high suspiciousness of fraud. My proposed approach for fraud detection is supervised and involves developing a broad range of classifiers on labeled training data to help identify potential providers who might overbill insurers. I also provide reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of flagged providers by analyzing important features. Additionally, I apply SMOTE techniques to handle imbalanced data and improve 1-fold lift recall for the minority/fraud class. The results can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious providers for both public and private health insurance systems.
## Healthcare Provider Fraud overview
Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types that providers deceive insurers through claims procedures are listed below:
* Phantom Billing. Providers billing for services not provided.
* Unnecessary Services. Providers administering (more) tests and treatments that are not medically necessary.
* Upcoding. Providers administering more expensive tests and equipments.
* Multiple-billing. Providers multiple-billing for services rendered.
* Unbundling. Providers unbundling or billing separately for laboratory tests to get higher reimbursements.
* False price reporting. Providers charging more than peers for the same services.
## Medicare claims dataset
The dataset in this project comes from Kaggle's website - [Healthcare Provider Fraud Dection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) by Rohit Anand Gupta. The dataset consists of four sub-datasets, as listed below.

## Data Preporcessing
Before discussing the extensive data analysis performed on the claims data, I would like to explain how the data was preprocessed. First, handle missing values in the data. Missing information should be imputed accordingly. we also can enrich data informantion by creating new features. For example, in benificiaries dataset, the date of death was missing if a patient was alive,  and in inpatient dataset. I create two new features 'if-alive' and 'Age' using the date of birth and death. 

Next, label encode categorical data and scale numerical data for uniform and efficient preprocessing. Here, I used Robustscaler to scale features for it use statistics that are robust to outliers. The outliers in the data were kept, as those outliers could provide important fraud indicator information, and sometime themselvs were the signal that actual fraud transcations were being committed. 

Another important preprocessing step was resampling the data to make imbalanced data ratio to 1:1. Data Imbalance is a typical scenario overcomes in many business problems like fraud detection, spam filtering, rare disease discovery, hardware fault detection, etc. Generally, the minority/positive class is the bussiness main concern and is aimed to achieve the best results. If the imbalanced data is not treated beforehand, most of the predictions will correspond to the majority class and treat the minority class features as noise in the data and ignore them. This will result in a high bias in the model and degrade the performance of the classifier model. Resampling data is one of the most commonly preferred approaches to deal with an imbalanced dataset, including undersampling and oversampling. Here, I used two resampling techqiques: 1) SMOTE. It randomly oversampling data by choosing one of K instances to interpolate new synthetic instances. 2)SMOTE+ENN. It is a hybrid technique.  ENN is undersampling technique, removing the nearest neighbors of each of the majority class is estimated. ENN intergate with SMOTE could clean overlapping data points for each of the classes distributed in sample space and optimize the performance of classifier models and avoid overfiting.
